        Q-01: Difference between foreach, map, find and filter
      </h1>

      <p>
        Answer: <br />
        ForEach, map, find, and filter are all array methods in JavaScript, but
        they have different purposes and behaviors. Here are the differences
        between them:
      </p>

      <p>
        i. forEach - <br />
        Basically, the forEach() method lets you run a function on every element
        in an array. This means you can do something to each item in the array
        without having to write a bunch of code for each one. One thing to keep
        in mind is that the forEach() method doesn't create a new array or
        change the original one. Instead, it changes the values of the existing
        array elements based on the result of the function you provide. It's
        also important to note that the forEach() method doesn't return
        anything. This means you can't use it to get a new array or a modified
        version of the original one. Overall, the forEach() method is a handy
        tool for working with arrays in JavaScript. Give it a try and see how it
        can make your coding life easier!
      </p>
      <p>
        ii. map() - <br />
        method The map() method, similar to the forEach() method, executes the
        provided function once for each element in an array. But unlike the
        forEach() method, it creates a new array with the results of calling a
        function for every array element. Hence map() method relies on
        immutability. Also, map() does not execute/call the function for those
        array elements without values.So that's map() in a nutshell! It's a
        really useful tool for working with arrays, and it can help you do some
        really cool things.
      </p>

      <p>
        iii. filter() - <br />
        creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented
        by the provided function. The original array is not modified. It returns
        a new array with only the elements that meet the specified condition.
        It's often used when you need to filter an array based on a specific
        condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        iv. find() - <br />
        find method returns the first element in an array that satisfies a
        provided condition. It returns the value of the first element in the
        array that meets the condition specified by the callback function. It is
        used when we want to find a specific element in an array. If in an array
        is more than one result, the function will return the first that has
        matched.
      </p>
      <br />

      In summary, forEach is used to loop through an array and execute a
      function on each element, map is used to create a new array with the
      results of calling a function on each element, find is used to find the
      first element that satisfies a condition, and filter is used to create a
      new array with all elements that satisfy a condition. <br />

        Q-02: Difference between local storage, session storage and Cookies
      </h1>
      <p>
        Answer: <br />
        localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are all used to store data on
        the client-side in web browsers. There are some differences between
        them. Here's a brief explanation of the difference between them: <br />

        i. Local storage: <br />
        Local storage is a method for storing data in a client's browser that
        persists even after the browser window is closed. The data is stored
        locally on the client's device and is accessible from any page on the
        same domain. Local storage can store a larger amount of data than
        cookies and session storage, typically up to 5-10 MB depending on the
        browser.Overall, local storage is a handy tool for keeping your data
        safe and accessible. <br />

        ii.Session storage: <br />
        Session storage is a method for storing data in a client's browser that
        persists only for the duration of the browser session. Once the browser
        window is closed, the data is lost. Session storage can store a larger
        amount of data than cookies, typically up to 5-10 MB depending on the
        browser. The data is accessible from any page on the same domain during
        the same session. <br />

        iii.Cookies: <br />
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's browser by a
        website. They are used to store small amounts of data that can be used
        by the website for various purposes, such as tracking user behavior or
        storing user preferences. Cookies have a much smaller storage capacity
        than localStorage or sessionStorage (usually up to 4KB per cookie).
        Cookies can also have an expiration date, which means they will be
        automatically deleted by the browser once that date is reached. <br />
        <br />

        In summary, localStorage and sessionStorage provide a way to store data
        in a user's browser for a longer period of time than cookies, while
        cookies have a smaller storage capacity and can have an expiration date.

        Q-03: What is event loop? How does it work?
      </h1>

      <p>
        answer: <br />
        The event loop is a fundamental part of the JavaScript language and the
        JavaScript runtime environment. The event loop is responsible for
        managing the execution of code in a single thread, ensuring that tasks
        are processed in the correct order and that the thread does not become
        blocked. It ensures that code runs in a non-blocking way, so that the UI
        remains responsive and other operations can continue while a
        long-running task is being performed. <br />

        The event loop checks the call stack and the message queue indefinitely.
        When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the message queue
        for any outstanding tasks or events. If there is a job or event in the
        message queue, it is transferred to the call stack and performed. <br />

        Here's a simplified example of how the event loop works: <br />
        i. The JavaScript runtime maintains two primary components: the call
        stack and the event queue. The call stack is a data structure that
        tracks the execution of function calls in the program, while the event
        queue is a list of events and associated callback functions. <br />
        ii. When an event is triggered, such as a user clicking a button or a
        timer expiring, the callback function associated with that event is
        added to the event queue. <br />
        iii. When an event is found, the event loop dequeues the event and
        passes it to the appropriate event handler. <br />
        iv. Once the callback function has completed execution, the event loop
        returns to monitoring the call stack and event queue <br />
        v. This process continues indefinitely, with the event loop processing
        events in the order they are added to the queue and executing their
        associated callback functions when the call stack is empty.

      <h1 class="text-4xl mt-5 mb-5 font-semibold">quizTimer function</h1>
      The quizTimer function that sets up a timer to be used in a quiz. It takes
      a single argument, dismiss, which is a boolean value. If dismiss is true,
      the function will clear the interval and stop the timer. Otherwise, the
      function will continue running and updating the timer on the HTML document
      every second. If the count reaches 60 seconds, the function alternates the
      color of the text displayed using CSS classes called "text-red-300" and
      "text-red-700". The color changes every two seconds. The timer continues
      until it is dismissed by passing true as a parameter to the function or
      until the window is closed. <br /><br />

      <h1 class="text-4xl mt-5 mb-5 font-semibold">chooseQuiz function</h1>
      The chooseQuiz function is used to add or update the answer given by a
      user for a particular quiz question. The function first checks if there is
      already an answer for the question with the given index in the answers
      array. It does this by using the find method on the answers array to
      search for an answer object with an id property that matches the id of the
      question in the quizData array at the given index. Finally, the
      displayAnswers function is called with the answers array as an argument to
      update the UI with the latest quiz answers.
