        Q-01: Difference between foreach, map, find and filter
      </h1>

      <p>
        Answer: <br> ForEach, map, find, and filter are all array methods in
        JavaScript, but they have different purposes and behaviors. Here are the
        differences between them:
      </p>

      <p>
        i. forEach - <br>
         The forEach() method executes a provided function once
      for each element in an array. After executing the function for every array
      element, this method changes the values of the existing array elements
      according to the result of the provided function. Hence forEach() is a
      mutator method. It does not create a new array or modify the original
      array. Also, forEach method doesn’t return anything (undefined).
      </p>
      <p>
        ii. map() - <br>
      method The map() method, similar to the forEach() method, executes the
      provided function once for each element in an array. But unlike the
      forEach() method, it creates a new array with the results of calling a
      function for every array element. Hence map() method relies on
      immutability. Also, map() does not execute/call the function for those
      array elements without values.
      </p>

      <p>
        iii. filter() - <br>
         creates a new array with all
      the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The
      original array is not modified. It returns a new array with only the
      elements that meet the specified condition. It's often used when you need
      to filter an array based on a specific condition.
      </p> 
      
      <p>
        iv. find() - <br>
        find method returns the first element in an array that satisfies a provided condition. It returns the value of the first element in the array that meets the condition specified by the callback function. It is used when we want to find a specific element in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.
      </p> <br>

      In summary, forEach is used to loop through an array and execute a function on each element, map is used to create a new array with the results of calling a function on each element, find is used to find the first element that satisfies a condition, and filter is used to create a new array with all elements that satisfy a condition. <br>

        Q-02: Difference between local storage, session storage and Cookies

      </h1>
      <p> Answer: <br>
        localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies are all used to store data on the client-side in web browsers. There are some differences between them. Here's a brief explanation of the difference between them: <br>

        i. Local storage: <br>
         Local storage is a method for storing data in a client's browser that persists even after the browser window is closed. The data is stored locally on the client's device and is accessible from any page on the same domain. Local storage can store a larger amount of data than cookies and session storage, typically up to 5-10 MB depending on the browser. <br>

        ii.Session storage: <br>
         Session storage is a method for storing data in a client's browser that persists only for the duration of the browser session. Once the browser window is closed, the data is lost. Session storage can store a larger amount of data than cookies, typically up to 5-10 MB depending on the browser. The data is accessible from any page on the same domain during the same session. <br>

        iii.Cookies: <br>
         Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's browser by a website. They are used to store small amounts of data that can be used by the website for various purposes, such as tracking user behavior or storing user preferences. Cookies have a much smaller storage capacity than localStorage or sessionStorage (usually up to 4KB per cookie). Cookies can also have an expiration date, which means they will be automatically deleted by the browser once that date is reached. <br> <br>
         
         In summary, localStorage and sessionStorage provide a way to store data in a user's browser for a longer period of time than cookies, while cookies have a smaller storage capacity and can have an expiration date. <br> <br>
        </p>

            Q-03: What is event loop? How does it work?
          </h1>
          
         <p>
            answer: <br>
            The event loop is a fundamental part of the JavaScript language and the JavaScript runtime environment. The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of code in a single thread, ensuring that tasks are processed in the correct order and that the thread does not become blocked. It ensures that code runs in a non-blocking way, so that the UI remains responsive and other operations can continue while a long-running task is being performed. <br>
            
            The event loop checks the call stack and the message queue indefinitely. When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks the message queue for any outstanding tasks or events. If there is a job or event in the message queue, it is transferred to the call stack and performed. <br>

            Here's a simplified example of how the event loop works: <br>
            i. The JavaScript runtime maintains two primary components: the call stack and the event queue. The call stack is a data structure that tracks the execution of function calls in the program, while the event queue is a list of events and associated callback functions. <br>
            ii. When an event is triggered, such as a user clicking a button or a timer expiring, the callback function associated with that event is added to the event queue. <br>
            iii. When an event is found, the event loop dequeues the event and passes it to the appropriate event handler. <br>
            iv. Once the callback function has completed execution, the event loop returns to monitoring the call stack and event queue <br>
            v. This process continues indefinitely, with the event loop processing events in the order they are added to the queue and executing their associated callback functions when the call stack is empty.
